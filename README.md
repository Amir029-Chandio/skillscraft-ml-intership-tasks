### 📌 Steps Followed:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Sample dataset of house prices with columns such as area, bedrooms, and price.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing values and outliers.
   - Converted categorical variables (if any).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized correlations using heatmaps.
   - Created scatter plots and histograms.

4. **Model Building**
   - Built a Linear Regression model using `sklearn`.
   - Trained the model and evaluated with R² score and Mean Squared Error.

5. **Result Visualization**
   - Plotted predicted vs actual prices.
   - Evaluated performance using graphs and metrics.
